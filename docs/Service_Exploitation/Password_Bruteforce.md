# Weak Passwords & Password Bruteforcing

Defeating weak passwords is one of the low-hanging fruits that should be exploited during an
engagement.

In order to brute force weak password several tools, online and offline, can come to our aid.

## Online Tools

* [Ncrack](http://nmap.org/ncrack/), this has mostly been replaced by Nmap NSE.
* [Hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra)
* [Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator)
* [Medusa](https://github.com/jmk-foofus/medusa)

A mention is also due to [EyeWitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness), that it's not a
real brute-forcer, but is a very useful tool to automatically browse sites, try default credentials
and take screenshots.

## Offline Tools

In order to crack passwords offline the 2 major tools used are:

* [JohnTheRipper](https://www.openwall.com/john/)
* [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)

## Generating Wordlists

Both online attacks and offline attempts are successful only if the dictionary used to perform them
is complete and accurate. 

In addition to projects such as (Seclists)[https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists] which contain
actual dictionaries, in some cases there might be the necessity to generate a specific wordlist,
maybe related to some subject. For this purpose there are some tools that can help us:

* [Rsmangler](https://digi.ninja/projects/rsmangler.php) can take a set of words and perform
  manipulations, combinations and permutations, generating a large set of variations.
* [CeWL](https://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php) is a tool that can generate wordlists from webpages
  (that might later be fed into Rsmangler).
