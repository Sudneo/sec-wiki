### Search for unquoted paths

Unquoted paths can be used to maintain persistence. If a Windows service is configured to run an
executable which in both unquoted and contains spaces, Windows will search for .exe files in every
path after a space, until it finds one.

```
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode|findstr/i"auto" |findstr/i/v "c:\windows\\" |findstr/i/v """
```
