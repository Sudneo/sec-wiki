To upgrade the shell from a raw reverse shell (e.g., netcat session) do the following:

### Classic Python upgrade

`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

### Put shell to background

`Ctrl+Z`

### Check the value of the following ENV variables

```bash
echo $TERM
stty -a
```

### Run

`stty raw -echo`

### Bring process to foreground again

`fg`

### Reset

type `reset` and enter

### Insert terminal type

This will be requested by the reset command. Here the value gotten from `echo $TERM` needs to be
put

### Export variables to make the terminal look better

```bash
export SHELL=bash
# (might change)
export TERM=screen
# (might change)
stty rows 57 columns 238
```
